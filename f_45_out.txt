i would now like to take a look at a subject which is extremely interesting but almost entirely academic in nature this is the subject of the energetics of computing we want to address the question how much energy must be used in carrying out a computation this doesnt sound all that academic after all a feature of most modem machines is that their energy consumption when they run very fast is quite considerable and one of the limitations of the fastest machines is the speed at which we can drain off the heat generated in their components such as transistors during operation the reason i have described our subject as academic is because we are actually going to ask another of our fundamental questions what is the minimum energy required to carry out a computation to introduce these more physical aspects of our subject i will return to the field covered in the last chapter namely the theory of information it is possible to treat this subject from a strictly physical viewpoint and it is this that will make the link with the energy of computation to begin with i would like to try to give you an understanding of the physical definition of the information content of a message that physics should get involved in this area is hardly surprising remember shannon was initially interested in sending messages down real wires and we cannot send messages of any kind without some interference from the physical world i am going to illustrate things by concentrating on a particular very basic physical model of a message being sent i want you to visualize the message coming in as a sequence of boxes each of which contains a single atom in each box the atom can be in one of two places on the left or the right side if its on the left that counts as a zero bit if its on the right its a one so the stream of boxes comes past me and by looking to see where each atom is i can work out the corresponding bit to see how this model can help us understand information we have to look at the physics of jiggling atoms around this requires us to consider the physics of gases so i will begin by taking a few things i need from that let us begin by supposing we have a gas containing n atoms or molecules occupying a volume v one we will take this gas to be an exceptionally simple one each atom or molecule within it we take the terms to be interchangeable here is essentially free there are no forces of attraction or repulsion between each constituent this is actually a good approximation at moderately low pressures i am now going to shrink the gas pushing against its volume with a piston compressing it to volume v two i do all this isothermally that is i immerse the whole system in a thermal bath at a fixed temperature t so that the temperature of my apparatus remains constant isnt it wonderful that this has anything to do with what were talking about im going to show you how first we want to know how much work w it takes to compress the gas now a standard result in mechanics has it that if a force f moves through a small distance dx the work done dw is fdx if the pressure of the gas is p and the cross sectional area of the piston is a we can rewrite this using f equals pa and letting the volume change of the gas dv equals adx so that dw is pdv now we draw on a standard result from gas theory for an ideal gas at pressure p volume v and temperature t we have the relation pv equals nkt where n is the number of molecules in the gas and k is boltzmanns constant as t is constant our isothermal assumption we can perform a simple integration to find w since v two is smaller than v one this quantity is negative and this is just a result of the convention that work done on a gas rather than by it has a minus sign now ordinarily when we compress a gas we heat it up this is a result of its constituent atoms speeding up and gaining kinetic energy however in our case if we examine the molecules of the gas before and after compression we find no difference there are the same number and they are jiggling about no more or less energetically than they were before there is no difference between the two at the molecular level so where did the work go we put some in to compress the gas and conservation of energy says it had to go somewhere in fact it was converted into internal gas heat but was promptly drained off into the thermal bath keeping the gas at the same temperature this is actually what we mean by isothermal compression we do the compression slowly ensuring that at all times the gas and the surrounding bath are in thermal equilibrium
